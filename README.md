# CROSSRULE

**Social | Community Moderation | Group Consensus**

CROSSRULE is a complete, wallet-native social governance system where **two autonomous communities negotiate a shared rulebook**, approve it independently, converse in a joint room, challenge specific posts under cited clauses, and appeal an AI-assisted ruling. The rulebook, procedural deadlines, evidence, and decisions are public GenLayer Intelligent Contract state. Neither community can impose a rule on the other.

**Current release status:** source implementation and local automated test foundation. **No contract deployment, live finalist receipts, production URL, or Portal 5/5/5/5 review has been established by this repository.** Do not mistake successful mock/Direct Mode tests for live multi-validator finality. Source authorship and final deployment/review evidence are separate deliverables.

## Exact stack

| Layer | Pinned implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Network | GenLayer StudioNet, chain `61999`, `https://studio.genlayer.com/api` |
| Contract | One Python Intelligent Contract, `contracts/Crossrule.py` |
| Contract developer CLI | Local `genlayer@0.39.1` (root lockfile) |
| JS SDK | `genlayer-js@1.1.8` |
| Web | Next.js `16.4.3`, React `19.3.1`, TypeScript `5.9.3`, Tailwind `4.3.3` |
| Wallet | User-injected EIP-1193 provider; user signs all writes |
| Frontend hosting | Vercel static/client-connected app |
| Test tools | `genlayer-test==0.29.2`, `genvm-linter==0.11.0`, Vitest, Playwright |
| Server / database / indexer / keeper | **None** |

Do not upgrade to the Bradbury/consensus-v0.6 SDK family within this locked StudioNet release. Validate that the target RPC and SDK combination still work before deployment.

## Product in one story

1. Wallet A creates **Builders**, nominates two founding wallet addresses, and both invitees independently accept. Three founders are required to activate a community. A separate trio creates **Researchers**. A wallet cannot sit on both sides of an agreement.
2. Community members may propose a fourth member. The invitee must consent and two-thirds of the frozen roster must approve; no more than 12 wallets belong to one community. Community charters are independently versioned by two-thirds voting.
3. A member of either community proposes a joint room and specifies agreement text, 1–6 explicit clauses, each clause's maximum penalty, and **all four durations from the frontend**: vote, defense, appeal, and suspension. All durations are 2–10,080 minutes. The governance snapshot is frozen at proposal time.
4. **Two-thirds of each community, counted separately**, must approve; a simple combined majority cannot override either community. Failed initial ratification rejects that proposed room. Later amendments require the same bilateral process and create a new version; old cases retain their original policy snapshot.
5. Room members create text posts and replies. Two-thirds approval by each community can feature or unfeature a post. Public readers can inspect the feed, agreement, and audit without a wallet.
6. Another room member may challenge a post by citing one ratified clause and up to three prior same-room context posts. The author receives the frozen defense window; evidence is then hashed and sent to GenLayer's leader/validator LLM process. Validators independently assess the case; the equivalence logic requires a matching **decision-bearing classification**, not merely plausible prose.
7. Findings: `NO_VIOLATION`, `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`, `MINOR_BREACH`, or `SERIOUS_BREACH`. Minor and serious proven breaches hide the post from the official feed. Serious requires a clause that explicitly allows it, and suspends the author from that room for the proposed duration. An appeal can restore the post and remove the case-specific suspension. An upheld serious sanction does **not** restart its clock.
8. The adversely affected party can file **one application-level appeal** within the policy's appeal window; the other party may respond during the frozen response window. An independent GenLayer semantic reassessment closes the case. The application appeal is distinct from GenLayer protocol-level challenges/finality.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22 and Python 3.12.

```bash
npm ci
npm run genlayer -- --version

cd frontend
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Before deployment, the UI truthfully displays **Source build · not deployed**. To connect the deployed contract, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CROSSRULE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...` in the frontend's Vercel project environment and redeploy. No server-side signing key or API secret is needed; never store an application private key in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.

### Quality gates

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_contract_offline.py -v
python -m pip install genlayer-test==0.29.2 genvm-linter==0.11.0
genvm-lint check contracts/Crossrule.py
python -m pytest tests/direct -v

cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

**Direct Mode GenVM artifact note:** In `genlayer-test==0.29.2`, a first-run download may request an obsolete `genvm-universal.tar.xz` GitHub release name and fail with 404. Run `genvm-lint check` first, then share the verified linter tarball with the Direct Mode cache (implemented in the CI workflow); do not silently disable Direct Mode testing.

## Time safety

Every proposal's own duration is adjustable in the web UI from **2 minutes to 7 days**, with short windows for quick demonstration. Voting, membership, and charter deadlines are frozen when initiated; case defense, appeal eligibility, appeal response, and sanction durations are inherited from the jointly ratified policy version, which was configured from the UI. On-chain timestamps determine enforcement. `freeze_case`, `freeze_appeal` and deadline-based closure are permissionless write calls made by a participant; **no background scheduler** auto-advances state. GenLayer network execution, consensus, appeals, and finality have their own timing that **cannot** be accelerated from the application. A 2-minute window may close before an on-chain transaction finalizes; use longer windows for production and final live demonstrations.

## Immutable scope / boundaries

- No admin, owner, pause, upgrade, force-finalize, centralized moderator, arbitrary oracle or back-end signing authority.
- No Supabase, Cloudflare Worker, database, hidden LLM service, off-chain reputation or custodial funds.
- No third community, AI autoposting, token rewards, stake/slash economics, hidden moderation content deletion, external social-platform integration, or infinite-scroll indexer.
- Text content remains recoverable from public contract storage even if marked hidden in the official feed. Users must never post secrets or private data.
- The application supports **one challenge and one appeal per post**. The contract enforces **12 members per community and 150 posts per room** to bound public on-chain storage. These are intentional present-scope constraints, not placeholders for a later V2.
- A future Portal milestone may introduce different functionality, but it is outside this complete initial submission.

## Documentation

- [Deployment and reviewer closeout checklist](docs/HANDOFF.md)

The 5/5/5/5 Portal rubric is a **target**, not a guaranteed score. Live finalized SUCCESS receipts, source parity, consensus observations and reviewer acceptance must be independently proven after deployment.
