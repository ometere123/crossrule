# Deployment and final engineering closeout — source checklist

This is an internal task checklist, not an external Codex prompt. The project owner will pass a separate complete implementation/deployment prompt to Codex via chat. Do not save that prompt in the repository.

## Locked parameters

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Repo | `https://github.com/ometere123/crossrule` |
| Network | GenLayer StudioNet 61999 |
| RPC | `https://studio.genlayer.com/api` |
| Single contract | `contracts/Crossrule.py` |
| CLI | repo-local `genlayer@0.39.1` |
| Frontend SDK | `genlayer-js@1.1.8` |
| Frontend | Next.js 16.4.3, React 19.3.1, TS 5.9.3, Tailwind 4.3.3 |
| Hosting | Vercel, project root `frontend` |
| Wallet | injected EIP-1193 only |
| Duration config | 2–10,080 minutes, from frontend, immutable per vote/policy/case |

## Final engineer's non-optional checks

- Verify current chain and SDK compatibility **without silently changing the locked stack**. Report a true compatibility blocker, if discovered.
- Fresh checkout: run root `npm ci`, `frontend/npm ci`, Python offline suite, `genvm-lint`, real Direct Mode suite, frontend lint/typecheck/unit/build, Playwright desktop and mobile, and GitHub CI.
- Expand Direct Mode test coverage for membership/charter/feature/amendment/failures, forged context, freeze boundaries, and policy version snapshots; add mutation tests and prove each important mutation is killed.
- Inspect contract for GenVM resource limits, storage constraints, exception behavior, no privileged paths, and semantic LLM consensus under real validators.
- Inspect frontend for every actionable call and read signature; test connected and disconnected provider behavior, chain switching, finalized receipt parsing, bad RPC/timeout, mobile ergonomics, accessibility, and content safety.
- Deploy exactly the reviewed **single contract source** to StudioNet; capture contract address, deploy transaction and `FINALIZED + SUCCESS` receipt; prove source parity by retrieving chain code.
- Configure only `NEXT_PUBLIC_CROSSRULE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in Vercel; redeploy same reviewed Git SHA and verify clean served pages.
- Execute and archive genuine positive and negative multi-wallet lifecycle evidence in `docs/evidence` or via verifiable links with identities and links, never secret keys.
- Do not claim a network-level finality or validator decision if it is a local mock, pending receipt or UI-only transaction.
- Verify all application timers can be chosen from the frontend; explain why network consensus/finality timing is external.
- Produce final acceptance report mapping concrete evidence to the four 5/5/5/5 target axes, including remaining risks and genuine review outcome when available.

## Scope freeze

No admin, owner, pause, upgrade, backend, external AI API, worker, database, Docker requirement, escrow, wallet import, external social integration, token incentives, privacy promises or new milestone features. An unrelated future milestone may be discussed separately after this full initial delivery; **do not phase or dilute the current locked scope**.
